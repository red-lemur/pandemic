### To compile this project, use the following command :
```{bash}
make
```

### You can execute the program with :
```{bash}
$ ./bin/main
```
Do not run the other binary files, or they may loop endlessly.
If you executed them anyway, you can stop them with the command ```kill -9```
followed by the PID of the processes (you can find their PID with the command ```ps -e```).
